Don't Be A Jerk v2.1 (Modified slightly from [original](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakimfett/DBaJ/master/LICENSE.md))

This computer software code ("the code") is ©2016 QuarkTheAwesome ("the author") all rights reserved, and is licensed for use and redistribution under the “Don’t Be a Jerk v2” non-commercial care-free license. 

i) Preface and TL;DR

In case you aren't in the mood to interpret legalese today, I've included this section as a "wrapup" of the license's main points. In all cases, the license takes higer priority than the wrapup, so if I contradict something up here you should stick with the rules down below.  
Basically you can do whatever you want with the code or binaries as long as you don't claim ownership of my code and you don't re-upload it to another website (derivative works are excepted). You also can't use AdF.ly or similar websites in conjunction with this code, or any other way of making money from the code. Specific exemptions below.  
Also give credit and don't hold me liable for anything. That's basically the entire license - if you're confused, read on below. (However, I cannot stress enough that in a legal sense, the above few paragraphs mean nothing! All the actual licese stuff that you should stick to is below, but it's basically the same thing.)

1) Scope

This means that you’re free to pretty much do what you like with the the code (source) or compiled binaries (dll/zip/exe files), including but not limited to:

a) Download code or compiled binaries for personal use  
b) Put the code or compiled binaries into your project/plugin etc  
c) Fork the repository on GitHub  
d) Compile the code  
e) Modify the code to:  
 - fix bugs  
 - add features  
 - fit better with your project/plugin etc  
 - remove a problematic object  
 - replace all icons with cat pictures, because cats  

f) Use portions of the code as examples in a presentation  
g) Record portions of use for display on YouTube or other video/media sites  

The above usage is granted to you as long as this license remains intact for all original or derived code and credit is given to the original author. Please include a copy of this license with the code, or provide a link to this document, just to make sure everyone's as cool as you.

2) Ownership

a) This licence specifically prohibits you from claiming the the code or compiled binaries are yours without permission from the previous author(s).

b) To ensure a lack of confusion on this point, all derivative works are required to give credit to the original author which must include the name of the author, the name of the project and a link back to the original project; whether that be source code or compiled binaries.

c) You are also prohibited from sharing or re-uploading the code or compiled binaries to any website unless it is part of a derivative work. The author has the final say as to whether or not something constitutes a derivative work.

3) Non-Commercial Status

a) You are expressly prohibited from making or trying to make money from the code, derivatives of the code, compiled portions of the code, etc etc.

b) This license specifically prohibits you from using AdF.ly or AdF.ly clones (any "click past an ad before you can download" service) to make money or attempt to make money for clicks or downloads.

c) Specific exceptions to the non-commercial nature of this license are granted to any derivative works of art. Here's some specific exemptions:

 - If you make a cool tee-shirt design based off the code and want to sell that, it's completely ok.
 - Want to use the the code or compiled binaries as part of a charity event? Go ahead.
 - Make money from tutorial videos, articles or other "commentary" type uses, e.g. reviews or how-to videos? No problem.

d) Ultimately, your work is your own. This license is designed to protect against jerks trying to make money off someone else's work. Any exemptions not listed here require permission from the code author.

4) Damages

This license prohibits any attempt to hold the author liable for damages caused by usage of the the code or compiled binaries. Bugs happen, so make backups, and don't complain if your project/plugin gets corrupted. Seriously, make backups.

5) Reserved Rights

I reserve the right to change this license at any time, although chances are I won't, because legalese annoys me.
I also reserve the right to request the takedown of any derivative or non-derivative work related to or based on the code. I have the final say on everything related to the use of my code, even if it contradicts this license.

6) Conclusion

Ultimately, don't be a jerk, play nice, be polite, and you'll be fine.
